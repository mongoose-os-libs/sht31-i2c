# SHT31 I2C Driver

A Mongoose library for Sensirion's SHT31 integrated circuit.

## Sensor details

SHT3x-DIS is the next generation of Sensirion’s temperature and humidity
sensors. It builds on a new CMOSens sensor chip that is at the heart of
Sensirion’s new humidity and temperature platform. The SHT3x-DIS has increased
intelligence, reliability and improved accuracy specifications compared to its
predecessor. Its functionality includes enhanced signal processing, two
distinctive and user selectable I2C addresses and communication speeds of up
to 1 MHz. The DFN package has a footprint of 2.5 x 2.5 mm while keeping a
height of 0.9 mm. This allows for integration of the SHT3x-DIS into a great
variety of applications.

Additionally, the wide supply voltage range of 2.4 to 5.5 V guarantees
compatibility with diverse assembly situations. All in all, the SHT3x-DIS
incorporates 15 years of knowledge of Sensirion, the leader in the humidity
sensor industry.

## Example application

An example program using a timer to read data from the sensor every 5 seconds:

```
#include "mgos.h"
#include "mgos_i2c.h"
#include "mgos_sht31.h"

static struct mgos_sht31 *s_sht31;

static void timer_cb(void *user_data) {
  float temperature, humidity;

  temperature=mgos_sht31_getTemperature(s_sht31);
  humidity=mgos_sht31_getHumidity(s_sht31);

  LOG(LL_INFO, ("sht31 temperature=%.2f humidity=%.2f", temperature, humidity));

  (void) user_data;
}

enum mgos_app_init_result mgos_app_init(void) {
  struct mgos_i2c *i2c;

  i2c=mgos_i2c_get_global();
  if (!i2c) {
    LOG(LL_ERROR, ("I2C bus missing, set i2c.enable=true in mos.yml"));
  } else {
    s_sht31=mgos_sht31_create(i2c, 0x44); // Default I2C address
    if (s_sht31) {
      mgos_set_timer(5000, true, timer_cb, NULL);
    } else {
      LOG(LL_ERROR, ("Could not initialize sensor"));
    }
  }
  return MGOS_APP_INIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
